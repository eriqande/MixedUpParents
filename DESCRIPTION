Description: Uses markers with alleles diagnostic for different species
    to infer (via an heuristic algorithm) the number of doses (0, 1, or 2)
    of ancestry from each species at different segments within each individual's
    genome.  Uses those "ancestry copy numbers" to estimate allele frequencies
    in each species at a set of variable/polymorphic markers. Then uses all of the
    above to calculate the likelihood that any pair is parental vs unrelated.
